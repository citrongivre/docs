#### Full Toolset

The most complete toolset which you can use to style without giving you any predefined styles.

#### No output

By default, there is no output at all from Henri's. So you can use it without putting any extra weight on your style.


#### Framework independent

The only thing you need is Sass. Henri's can work with any framework in any setup.
